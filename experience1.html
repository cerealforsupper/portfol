  <h1 class="scroll-reveal">SWRAP @ STMicroelectronics</h1>
  <p class="scroll-reveal">I had the opportunity to go for a 4 day work attachment program at STMicroelectronic's AMK plant to learn more about the production and manufacturing of semiconductors. This was done through the SWRAP program (Structured Work Reasearch & Attachment Programme).</p>

  <h2 class="scroll-reveal">Day 1 | Introduction</h2>
  <section class="section active scroll-reveal">
    <p>Us students were given a tour around the STMicroelectronics facility to familiarise ourselves with the place. We also had a brief introduction session to the company to learn more about what STMicroelectronics do.</p>

  <h2 class="scroll-reveal">Day 2 | Job Shadowing</h2>
  <section class="section active scroll-reveal">
    <p>As part of the work attachment program, I was assigned to a mentor for job shadowing. I was brought to the filter and abatement section where I learnt how waste produced by the production of wafers for chips are sustainbly dealt with.</p>

  <h2 class="scroll-reveal">Day 3 | Fab Lab Tour & Product Development</h2>
  <section class="section active scroll-reveal">
    <p>We were given the rare opportunity to actually enter and visit a wafer fabrication lab where I gained a deeper insight into the manufacturing of wafers for semiconductors. The entire section was very uncontaminated as small dust particles would significantly affect wafer production in the Lab.</p>
    <p>We also had the chance to meet the product development team where they presented on how products of the company go from the drawing board all the way into the market.</p>

  <h2 class="scroll-reveal">Day 4 | Conclusion</h2>
  <section class="section active scroll-reveal">
    <p>To end off things, we presented on our journey through the previous 3 days infront of the mentors and staff that had guided us through.</p>
    <p>This experience has taught me that many of the technologies such as semiconductors found in our everyday devices are not easily made and should not be taken for granted. I also gained much insight on other sections such as what it is like to work in the semiconductor industry and sustainable ethics in company actions.</p>
