  <h1 class="scroll-reveal">OLE to Jakarta</h1>
  <p class="scroll-reveal">I embarked on a 5 day overseas learning experience to Jakarta as part of a student exchange program. There I had the chance to experience what it was like to be a student in Jakarta, and also the diverse cultures found there.</p>
  <p class="scroll-reveal">I also had a buddy who had arrived to Singapore a few weeks prior as part of the exchange program. We spent time with each other and learnt much about how different our lives are despite our close geographical proximities.</p>
